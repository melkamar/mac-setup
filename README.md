# mac-setup
My MacOS setup that somewhat imitates the Czech Windows layout

- https://github.com/b-ryan/powerline-shell
- https://github.com/powerline/fonts (Roboto)

## Software
- Nimble commander (tcmd replacement)
- Hyperswitch (alt-tabbing like windows)
- Spectacle (keyboard shortcuts for window management - side by side, corners, maximize...)
- Karabiner (total keyboard customization)
